# 1. stop if an intermediate upload has been done to ubuntu but not backported in the packaging branch
# 2. collect all bugs that have been fixed in upstream trunk, and sort them by name in the changelog. The matching is really permissive: wide variety of format either --fixes lp: or in the commit message
# 3. Filters them with the eventual manual cherry-pick upload done in between (don't repeat if already fixed in distro)
# 4. Opens the downstream task automatically
# 
# 8. propose for merging and accept automatically the changelog changes for the day.
# 
# The bug collect doesn't depend on when the changelog commit is merged



# Metrics: number of bugs fixed per stack, per component, which onesâ€¦
