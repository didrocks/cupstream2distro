The format of these XML files is essentially undocumented (I googled for hours
and found NOTHING), but what you can do is make whatever changes you want to
the live jenkins job[0], and then visit the xml export[1] page, and then copy
the result of that overtop of these files here.

Note that the link to the config.xml file can be found by going to the very
bottom of the /configure page, clicking 'REST API', and then clicking the 'this
URL' link under the 'Fetch/Update config.xml' section. Or you can just
s/ure/.xml/ in the URL when you make a change.
